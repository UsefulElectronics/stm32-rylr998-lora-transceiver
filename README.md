### STM32 MCUs Communicating Using RYLR998 LoRa Module 
2 STM32 micro-controllers are communicating together using RYLR998 LoRa Module. RYLR998 interfaced over UART and its AT commands are explained in details. A higher layer LoRa based protocol is designed to transfer meaningful packets of data.

### STM32 LoRa Module Receiver Task
The code running on the receiver board has been added and now the receiver answers with acknowledgment packet back to the transmitter board. The transmitter board can also now handle the ACK packet and lights up an LED as ACK reception indication.

### STM32 LoRa Module Range Test

I have done a LoRa long range communication test to test the module limits. The test was done in several locations with gradual increase of communication distance. You won't believe how far I could get with these modules exchanging non corrupted data !.

A simple wireless PIR motion sensor is designed and build over LoRa. the project includes 2 board with to STM32 MCUs. One of them is interfacing a PIR sensor and the other one emulates siren sound using a buzzer. Two MCUs are communicating witlessly over LoRa
